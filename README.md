# Hello, Elixir!

A little dive into the world of Elixir.
I've started looking at this language because I was fascinated at the idea of [Processes], as well as the [Pheonix] framework (specifically LiveView).

My idea is to use this language to implement a simple multiplayer party game. The server will be displayed on a TV, and people can join a room from their phones. Very similar to Jackbox Party Games. We'll see if this idea will survive its trip to the project graveyard!

## Running

All the samples expect to be ran from the root of the project:
```sh
elixir lib/enum.exs
```
